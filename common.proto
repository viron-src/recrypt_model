// These types aren't actually imported by other proto files at all for two reasons.
// 1. enums are 32-bit while recrypt sequences/indices are 64-bit in nature.
// 2. the open/close behaviour and irregularities between language implementations make it difficult: https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/enum/

// This is really just a self-documenting file for interacting with such fields directly.
